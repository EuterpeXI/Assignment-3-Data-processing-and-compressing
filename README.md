# Assignment-3-Data-processing-and-compressing
Course: CMPT 201
Language: C

Done in a group of 3.

The objective of this assignment is to implement a data processing and compressing module and use it to:
• implement an application that can read a data file in .csv format and create a Database (a set of Data
Structures) to represent it
• implement an application that can interrogate and modify the data stored in the Database
• implement an application to compress the data in the Database for efficient transmission over a network
• create a dashboard which allows users to interact with your implementations
• test your programs extensively, including automated rules for your tests (we want to run the same tests
that you have!).

What I took care of was the data processing portion for the importing of data.
Any code on the compressing portion is not included in this repository.
