Course: CMPT 201;
Language: C

Done in a group of 3.

The objective of this assignment is to implement a data processing and compressing module and use it to (1) Implement an application that can read a data file in .csv format and create a Database (a set of Data Structures) to represent it; (2) Implement an application that can interrogate and modify the data stored in the Database; (3) Implement an application to compress the data in the Database for efficient transmission over a network; (4) Create a dashboard which allows users to interact with your implementations

I handled the data processing portion for the importing of data.
Any code on the compressing portion is not included in this repository.
