# Assignment-3-Data-processing-and-compressing
Course: CMPT 201
Language: C

Done in a group of 3.

The objective of this assignment is to implement a data processing and compressing module and use it to:
Implement an application that can read a data file in .csv format and create a Database (a set of Data
Structures) to represent it
Implement an application that can interrogate and modify the data stored in the Database
Implement an application to compress the data in the Database for efficient transmission over a network
Create a dashboard which allows users to interact with your implementations
Test your programs extensively, including automated rules for your tests (we want to run the same tests
that you have!).

What I took care of was the data processing portion for the importing of data.
Any code on the compressing portion is not included in this repository.
